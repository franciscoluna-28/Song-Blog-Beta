Thanks to this project I learned: 

🛠️ How to set up TypeScript in a project

🛠️ How to set up SASS in a project

🛠️ How to set up Gulp in a project

🛠️ Using TypeScript in a real project for the Front End

🛠️ Making components using SASS and SCSS

🛠️ How to set up complex routing in HTML

Things that I could've done better:

✔️ Using a framework for handling the CSS styles easier

✔️ Smaller font size in mobile

I loved doing this project even though it was really hard to finish. Fortunately, I finished it and you're free to check the songs that I created here: https://music-blog-beta-ts-sass.netlify.app
